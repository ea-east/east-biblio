     "Usage: list-canonical.sh [options] bib-file [bib-file ...]

- bib-file is a BibLaTeX database (.bib)

The default is to filter the database for what looks like Tibetan entries.

Recognized options to change the default behaviour are:

--help: show this message

Change output format:

--lisp: output the filtered records after parsing to s-expressions
--org:  output the filtered records in an org-mode table
--html: output the filtered records as an html table (based on org-mode)
--json: output the filtered records after converting to json

Modifiers:

--debug: say whatâ€™s going on
--verify: make sure the data is as expected

Sorting:

--sort-peking: sort by Peking number"))
