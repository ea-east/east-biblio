#+TITLE: README for EAST bibliographic records
#+AUTHOR: Patrick McAllister (pma@rdorte.org)


This repository is intended as a replacement for Tamboti.

The “official” repository URL is: gitolite@rdorte.org:east-biblio

The admin of that repository is Patrick McAllister.


* Layout of this repository


1) Two files:
   1) README.org
   2) README.html (derived from the org file, do not edit!)
2) Directories:
   1) file:./archived: contains all the bibliographic data in a
      normalized (mods) xml format
   2) file:./archived/sources: this directory contains all the
      bibliographic sources, in the raw format (they are not all MODS
      files).

* General workflow

Before starting to edit anything, *always* make sure your repository
is up to date. You can do this with

- ~git status~: checks for local changes
- ~git pull~: gets updates from the remote repositories

After you have finished your work, adding or changing entries, you
will usually want to share your changes, typically:

1) ~git commit~: add a short message describing what you did
2) ~git push~: send changes to central repository

** Adding new entries

1) Copy one of the entries in file:./archived/ to a new file with a
   meaningful (e.g., author + year) and unique name *in the same
   directory*, without the numeric prefix.
2) Edit as intended, keeping to the following rules:
   1) The root element must start with a tag like ~<mods xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3" xml:id="east-XXXX">~
   2) The most important thing is to add a unique identifier, the
      ~@xml:id~ attribute.  It’s best to use UUIDs (e.g., open or
      refresh https://www.uuidgenerator.net/, and copy the one
      suggested on the top). Please make sure it starts with a letter,
      for example by adding a prefix like “east-” to it.
   3) The file should be well-formed.  Validity will be checked at the
      backend (after a “git push”; TODO@pma: not yet implemented).
3) Be sure to tell git that you want to track the new file with ~git
   add~.


** Updating entries

- Simply open the file, and edit as you see fit.


* Git useful commands

** Check status

1) To see what has changed: ~git status~
2) To see differences: ~git diff~


** To save local changes

1) ~git commit -a~ (commits all changes locally)


** To share things

1) Get latest version: ~git pull~
2) Upload local version (if committed): ~git push~
