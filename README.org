#+TITLE: README for EAST’s bibliographic records
#+AUTHOR: Patrick McAllister (pma@rdorte.org)


The repository [[https://github.com/ea-east/east-biblio][east-biblio]] contains the bibliographic data for
[[https://east.ikga.oeaw.ac.at][*EAST*]]. Short for “Epistemology and Argumentation in South Asia and
Tibet”, *EAST* systematically collects information on works of
epistemology and argumentanion in South Asia and Tibet, their authors,
and relevant modern literature.


The bibliographic records are kept in a BibLaTeX file,
file:./bib/east.bib.  The records are encoded according to the general
[[http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf][BibLaTeX rules]] (see the section “Database guide”), and a set of
[[file:east-encoding.org][conventions specific to EAST]].


* Layout of this repository

The most important files are:

1) file:./README.org (this file)
2) file:./bib/east.bib: A single BibLaTeX file, to be edited by a
   program of choice (e.g., http://www.jabref.org/)
   - Whichever program you use, make sure that you use a “biblatex”
     editing mode (Jabref: Options -> Preferences -> General ->
     Default bibliography mode -> “BiBLaTeX”, for example)

The other directories contain files that should not be edited
normally.  They contain automatically generated content (pulled from
EAST’s database), and their content is subject to change.

1) file:./archived: contains all the bibliographic data in a
   normalized (mods) xml format
2) file:./archived/sources: this directory contains all the
   bibliographic sources, in the raw format (they are not all MODS
   files).


** Jabref hints

Here are some useful things to know about jabref:

1) *Use the search/filter function*: read
   https://help.jabref.org/en/Search. It’s somewhat obvious, but
   remember you can easily search for fields:
   1) ~journal = chizan~, or ~keywords=canonical~, etc.
   2) Combine them: ~keywords=canonical and title = tshad~
   3) For “spaces” in the search string, use quotes: ~keywords =
      canonical and translator = "zha ma"~
   4) Empty fields: ~author != .+~
   5) Finding Tibetan canonical entries where something is missing:
      - No co ne: ~language = bo and keywords = canonical and series
        != "co ne"~
      - No Peking: ~language = bo and keywords = canonical and series != Peking~
      - etc.
2) Linking to east: Take the numerical part of the bib_id (e.g.,
   ~27507~ in ~east:27507~), and add it to
   https://east.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/bib/ (e.g.:
   https://east.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/bib/27507)

* TODO General workflow

#+COMMENT: TODO: revise for better github workflow; maybe https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

Before starting to edit anything, *always* make sure your repository
is up to date. You can do this with

- ~git status~: checks for local changes
- ~git pull~: gets updates from the remote repositories

After you have finished your work, adding or changing entries, you
will usually want to share your changes, typically:

1) ~git commit~: add a short message describing what you did
2) ~git push~: send changes to central repository

The overall aim is then to add or update an entry in the main
bibliographic file, file:./bib/east.bib

** Guidelines for adding/updating entries

- We follow the BibLaTeX standards, as described in Chapter 2
  (“Database Guide”) of
  http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/exptl/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf,
  with *the following additional rule(s)*:
  - Bibliographic entries that contain data fields in multiple
    languages or scripts need to have the following format:
    ~transcribed-title-or-name [*translated title or name]~.  For example:
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    title = {Ninshikiron: chikaku no riron to sono tenkai [*Epistemology: the Theory of Perception and its Development]},
    #+END_SRC
    Note that in such cases we do not use Biblatex’s ~subtitle~ field!
- We use unicode encoding in the bib file.


* Git useful commands

** Check status

1) To see what has changed: ~git status~
2) To see differences: ~git diff~


** To save local changes

1) ~git commit -a~ (commits all changes locally)


** To share things

1) Get latest version: ~git pull~
2) Upload local version (if committed): ~git push~

* Bibliography processing

** Formatting the bibliography

EAST formats its bibliographic records with
file:styles/chicago-author-date-east.csl (see
https://github.com/ea-east/styles/commits/master/chicago-author-date-east.csl).

#+begin_SRC bash
  echo """---
  title: EAST Bibliography (formatted)
  nocite: |
   @*
  ...
  """ | pandoc \
            --standalone \
            --csl=styles/chicago-author-date-east.csl \
            --bibliography=bib/east.bib  \
            -o /tmp/east-bib.html
#+end_SRC


Or to see just a single record:

#+begin_SRC bash
  echo """---
  title: EAST Bibliography (formatted)
  nocite: |
   @east:27507
  ...
  """ | pandoc \
            --standalone \
            --csl=styles/chicago-author-date-east.csl \
            --bibliography=bib/east.bib  \
            -o /tmp/east-bib.html
#+end_SRC


** Conversions

For conversions between formats, first install bibutils
(https://sourceforge.net/p/bibutils/home/Bibutils/).

*** MODS -> bib(la)tex

 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   parallel xml2bib \
            --output-encoding unicode \
            --no-bom \
            --whitespace \
            --strictkey \
            --finalcomma \
            --brackets \
            --no-latex \
            ::: *xml > /tmp/east-bibs.bib
 #+END_SRC


*** biblatex -> MODS

 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   parallel biblatex2xml \
            --input-encoding unicode \
            --unicode-characters \
            --unicode-no-bom \
            --no-latex \
            ::: *.bib > /tmp/east-bibs.mods
 #+END_SRC


* Database/Django commands

To generate initial data from what’s in the Django backend, do
something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import os
  import shutil
  from biblio.models import BibliographicEntry
  from biblio.stuff import *
  from django.utils.text import slugify
  from lxml import etree

  outdir = "/tmp/east-biblio-exports"

  if os.path.exists(outdir):
      shutil.rmtree(outdir)

  os.makedirs(outdir)

  def write_bibs(bibs, subdir):
      """Write useful formats (mods, source, bib) of every bib in bibs (a
  query object) into outputdir/subdir."""
      suboutdir = os.path.join(outdir, subdir)

      if os.path.exists(suboutdir):
          shutil.rmtree(suboutdir)
      os.makedirs(suboutdir)
    

      for bib in bibs:
          basename = "%s__%s" % (bib.id,
                                 slugify(bib.pretty_short)[:40])
          modsoutfile = open(
              os.path.join(suboutdir,
                           "%s.mods.xml" % (basename)),
              "w")

          print("Writing %s" % modsoutfile)
          modsoutfile.write(
              etree.tostring(
                  etree.fromstring(bib.get_mods()),
                  encoding=str,
                  pretty_print=True
              ))
          modsoutfile.close()

          biboutfile = open(
              os.path.join(suboutdir,
                           "%s.bib" % (basename)),
              "w")

          print("Writing %s" % biboutfile)
          biboutfile.write(bib.get_bibtex(putids=True))
          biboutfile.close()

          sourceoutfile = open(
              os.path.join(suboutdir,
                           "%s.src" % (basename)),
              "w")
          print("Writing %s" % sourceoutfile)
          sourceoutfile.write(bib.source)
          sourceoutfile.close()



  write_bibs(BibliographicEntry.objects.filter(repository="TAMB"), "tamboti")
#+END_SRC


* TODO Notes


- [ ] Look for date/year fields containing “X” or “?” (something was
  unclear).

- [ ] Correct all occurrences of the macro “unknown” (see ~@string{unknown~).

- [ ] Check the ~misc~ and ~unpublished~ items.

- [ ] Some information was lost by ignoring
  ~//relatedItem[@type="otherVersion"]~ (e.g.,
  https://east.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/bib/5472/).

- [ ] Some information was lost due to preceding/following relations
  in MODS.

- Except for Śaṅkaranandana, EAST records very few manuscripts.
  If more manuscripts are to be added, we will probably want a dedicated type.
